# RelayduinoMqttController

An [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) project to control a [KTA-223 Relayduino](https://oceancontrols.com.au/KTA-223.html) via [MQTT](http://mqtt.org).


## Requirements

A KTA-223 Relayduino with an ethernet shield installed.

In addition, an MQTT broker is required to running and accessible from the Arduino.

Example code is included in [extras](extras), for [openHAB](http://openhab.org) and Python, to generate the required MQTT messages to control the relays and monitor inputs.

### Notes on the Relayduino

When the jumper labeled AUTO is installed the board will reset each time a serial connection is made to the USB serial port. This should only be installed when reprogramming via the Arduino Environment, or the device will reset each time a serial connection is made to the unit.

## Configuration

The code makes use of the [NetEEPROM library](https://github.com/gregington/NetEEPROM) to configure the MAC address of the Ethernet hardware. See the examples that accompany the library for how to set a MAC address. Utilising the library means the MAC address does not need to be defined in the code, allowing an IP address to be assigned automatically without code changes to multiple boards (assuming a DHCP server is available on network).

The MQTT broker address is required to be defined within the source code. Set the address on line 8 of file [mqttConfig.h](RelayshieldMqttController/mqttConfig.h).

## Compiling code

### PlatformIO

The project is structured for use with [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org). If using PlatformIO, the external libraries used in the project will be automatically added, however the following additional libraries will beed to be added to the project lib driectory

- [MemoryFree](https://github.com/sudar/MemoryFree)
- [Relayduino](https://github.com/greenthegarden/Relayduino)

For example

```
cd lib
rm -rf MemoryFree/
git clone https://github.com/sudar/MemoryFree.git
rm -rf Relayduino
git clone https://github.com/greenthegarden/Relayduino.git
```

### Arduino IDE

When using the KTA-223 with the Arduino Environment select “Arduino Duemilenove w/ ATmega328”
from the “Tools->Board” menu, and install the “AUTO” jumper on the PCB.

In addition the following additional libraries are required

- [NetEEPROM](https://github.com/gregington/NetEEPROM)
- [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient)
- [MemoryFree](https://github.com/sudar/MemoryFree)
- [Time]()
- [TimeAlarms]()
- [Relayduino](https://github.com/greenthegarden/Relayduino)

# Using program

In order to make use of the program, MQTT structured messages must be generated.

To control each relay a messaged is required with the topic

```
relayduino/control/relay
```

and payload `x,y`, where

- `x` is the relay number (1 to 8)
- `y` is either `0` for off or an integer to specify the duration, in mimutes, the relay should be on for.

For example to swich relay 2 on for 10 minutes, a message in the following form is used

```
relayduino/control/relay 2,10
```

On the change of state of a relay, a status message is generated by the Arduino, with the topic

```
relayduino/status/relay
```

and payload, in the format `x,y`, where

- `x` is the relay number (1 to 8)
- `y` is either `0` or `1` to signifity whether the relay is off or on, respectively.

Other status messages are generated for reliability. See the file [mqttConfig.h](RelayshieldMqttController/mqttConfig.h) for details.
